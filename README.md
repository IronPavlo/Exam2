# Introduction
This project is a shop for different leather goods, I got the idea of making it when i asked my brother what he would like to have me make for him and he asked for a shop where he could sell his hand-made leather goods.

# Requirements
- Visual Studio Code
- NodeJS(was made with v20.12.2)
- Windows 11(hasn't been tested with any other OS)
# Getting Started
1. Download the folders in this repository(examsite & NodeJS)
2. Extract the two folder & put them in the same folder
3. Open Visual Studio Code & open the folder that holds both examsite & NodeJS folders
4. Open the terminal and type in ```cd NodeJS``` then press enter
5. Then type in ```npm install``` and wait until it says how many packages were added
6. Then type in ```npm install nodemon -g``` and wait until it says how many packages were added
7. In the terminal type in ```cd examsite``` then press enter
8. Then type in ```npm install``` and wait until it says how many packages were added

# Build
To build the code you need to have two terminals one in which you ```cd NodeJS``` the other ```cd examsite``` in both you run ```npm run dev``` . In the examsite terminal you will see a local link, ctrl+click on it, this will take you to the site.
